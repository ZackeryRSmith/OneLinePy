A very simple script that converts python code to one line.

To use put your code into [code.py](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/OneLinePy/blob/main/code.py). Then run OneLinePy.py, a file called [out.py](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/OneLinePy/blob/main/out.py) should be generated. Running out.py will give the same result as running code.py. Boom, very simple stuff!
